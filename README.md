# A Clean Idea to organizing and managing SEO meta tags, title, and other tags in React websites and apps.

This repo is for inspirational use only. It isn't recommended for production use.

The main idea is a component that centralizes all SEO tags in one place base on routes. This method provides us a birds-eye view of Website SEO and makes this issue a first-class citizen in teamwork.

I used react-helmet to type less code, You can use anything you wish or develop your own solution.

### Notice:
react-helmet is not thread-safe on server-side. You may need to consider other packages or develop your own solution.

### Features:
- react 16
- react-router 4
- webpack 4
- Server-side rendering

### How to run/ test?
1. clone the repo
2. install modules using yarn or npm
3. run node index.js
